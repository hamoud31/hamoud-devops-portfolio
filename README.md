# Hamoud's DevOps Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my DevOps portfolio!  
This repository contains hands-on projects I've built to demonstrate my skills in DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, CI/CD, Monitoring, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

I’m passionate about automation, cloud technologies (AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform), and delivering secure, scalable infrastructure.  
Each project includes clear documentation, diagrams, and source code to help you follow the implementation process.
