Hamoud's DevOps Portfolio
Welcome to my DevOps portfolio! This repository showcases hands-on projects that demonstrate my expertise in Cloud Infrastructure, CI/CD, Monitoring, Security, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

I'm passionate about automation, cloud-native technologies (AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform), and building secure, scalable systems. Each project includes documentation, architecture diagrams, and source code to guide you through the implementation.
